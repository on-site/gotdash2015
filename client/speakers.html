            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>I have been working as a Developer for over 4 years and am currently employed full time as a Software Engineer at On-Site.com. My focus is on, but not to limited to Front-End development, User Interaction and Data Presentation.

            I like to be versed in a variety of programming languages. JavaScript is my primary love but I also enjoy programming in ruby, C#, Java, ActionScript 3, python, and so on.

            Specialties: User Interaction, User Interfaces, User Experience, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Web Design, Web Development, (X)HTML, CSS, PHP, C#, ObjectOriented Development
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Event Driven JavaScript Design</h4>
            <p>I will talk about Event Driven JavaScript Design. I will cover topics such as the concept of event based JavaScript, 'state and events', event listeners and dispatchers. I will also cover jQuery event binding, triggering, and proper use of namespaces and naming conventions. If time permits I will cover the Observer Pattern as described in Addy Osmani's book "JavaScript Design Patterns", when to use it and the benefits of using it.</p>

            <p>Edward has been tumbling with Ruby since 1936 and may continue to do so until the day he dies. In fact, he was named after a yet-to-be-fulfilled prophesy in the form of a recursive acronym, EDWARD: Edward Died While Aggravating Ruby Daemons. Edward has been optimized with -O3 -funroll-loops since his Gentoo days in 2003.</p>

            <h4>Safe Rewrites with Science</h4>
            <p>Rewriting an important part of your app can be super risky. Tests help a lot, but they can't cover everything and don't work with real-world data. And what about when the test just isn't feasible? In this talk, I demonstrate how I used the GitHub Scientist approach to rewriting a critical section of our code responsible for printing lease documents. Using this approach, we have prevented a significant number of bugs from going live that likely would have otherwise slipped through QA, which would have caused downtime for our customers and hotfix fires for us!</p>

            <h4>Git Conflict Resolution II: When diff3 Chokes</h4>
            <p>Last year I demonstrated how diff3 can make git conflicts a lot easier to understand. However sometimes there are those conflicts that no amount of blank staring helps make sense of. This year I will demonstrate an an additional method you can use to bring sanity to your conflict resolution, and maybe even get you excited to do it!</p>
